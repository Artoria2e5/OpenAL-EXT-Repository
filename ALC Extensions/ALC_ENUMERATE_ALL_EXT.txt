ALC_ENUMERATE_ALL_EXT

The Enumerate All Extension enables the application developer to retrieve
a complete list of device strings identifying all the available OpenAL
rendering devices and paths present on the user's PC. It works in exactly
the same manner as the Enumeration Extension, but it detects additional
audio paths that the standard extension will ignore. For instance, it will
return all the possible outputs in situations where the user has more than
one audio device installed, or under Windows Vista where the audio system
specifies different "endpoints" for sound such as Speakers, S/PDIF, etc...
If you don't require such complete control over the choice of output path,
then use the standard Enumeration Extension.
