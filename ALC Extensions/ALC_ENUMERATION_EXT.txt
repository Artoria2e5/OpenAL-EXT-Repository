9.5. ALC_ENUMERATION_EXT

An OpenAL 1.1 implementation will always support the ALC_ENUMERATION_EXT extension.
This extension provides for enumeration of the available OpenAL devices through
alcGetString. An alcGetString query of ALC_DEVICE_SPECIFIER with a NULL device
passed in will return a list of devices. Each device name will be separated by a
single NULL character and the list will be terminated with two NULL characters.

The Enumeration Extension enables the application developer to retrieve a list of
device strings identifying the different OpenAL rendering and capture devices present
on the user's PC. The OpenAL router takes care of querying the user's system to find
valid device implementations. Any of the strings returned by the enumeration extension
can be used to create a device during initialization via alcOpenDevice. This extension
is critical if you want to enable the user to select at run-time which device should
be used to render your OpenAL audio.

Naturally device enumeration is a very platform-specific topic. The mechanism might
not be implemented on platforms such as games consoles with fixed capabilities, where
multiple rendering devices are unnecessary.

Note that on PC the standard Enumeration Extension will not identify every potential
OpenAL output path. It will not return all the possible outputs in situations where
the user has more than one audio device installed, or under Windows Vista where the
audio system specifies different "endpoints" for sound such as Speakers, S/PDIF, etc...
If you require complete control over the choice of output path, use the "Enumerate All"
extension.
