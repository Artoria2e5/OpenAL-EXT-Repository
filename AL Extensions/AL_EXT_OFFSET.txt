9.2. AL_EXT_OFFSET

An OpenAL 1.1 implementation will always support the AL_EXT_OFFSET extension.
This allows an application written to the OpenAL 1.0 specification to access
the offset abilities expressed in section 4.3.2.

Offset tokens:
AL_SEC_OFFSET         0x1024
AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET      0x1025
AL_BYTE_OFFSET        0x1026
