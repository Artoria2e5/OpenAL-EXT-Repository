Dependencies

    This extension is for OpenAL 1.1.

Overview

    This extension adds buffer queries to get the length in bytes, samples,
    and seconds. Standard OpenAL only has queries for a buffer's storage size,
    the bits per sample, channel count, and sample rate, where the application
    needs to calculate what it wants from those. While this works alright for
    standard formats and most extension formats, it won't work for certain
    compressed formats like ADPCM. These extra queries ensure the application
    can get information about the buffer it may need.

Issues

    Q: Why can't the length be calculated from the available attributes for
       formats like ADPCM?
    A: When a compressed format like ADPCM is stored natively, there isn't an
       integer divisor that can get the sample frame count from the byte size.
       ADPCM samples are primarily 4 bits per sample, but they're contained in
       blocks that have extra data used for decompression (e.g. one or two
       initial uncompressed samples and initial block predictor values),
       resulting in a non-integer conversion factor. The AL_SAMPLE_LENGTH_SOFT
       query ensures the app can retrieve the sample frame count regardless of
       it being stored compressed or not.

       If the data is stored decompressed instead, that creates a different
       issue where the buffer size doesn't align with the source byte offset
       when playing. The buffer's AL_SIZE indicates the storage size, while
       the source's AL_BYTE_OFFSET represents the offset within the original
       data. The AL_BYTE_LENGTH_SOFT query ensures the app can correctly
       measure against the source's AL_BYTE_OFFSET property when played.

Additions to Specification

    Buffer Length Attributes

    Name                   Signature  Values        Default
    ---------------------  ---------  ------------  -------
    AL_BYTE_LENGTH_SOFT    i, iv      [0, INT_MAX]  0
    AL_SAMPLE_LENGTH_SOFT  i, iv      [0, INT_MAX]  0
    AL_SEC_LENGTH_SOFT     f, fv      [0.0f, Any]   0.0f

    Query only. Queries the length of the buffer, in bytes, sample frames, or
    seconds. The byte length is the size of the original data from the last
    successful call to alBufferData, the sample length is the number of sample
    frames stored in the buffer, and the length in seconds is the sample
    length divided by the buffer's sample rate.

    The lengths also represents the extents of a source offset when the buffer
    is attached to a static source, or the sole buffer queued on a streaming
    source. That is, the source's AL_BYTE_OFFSET will have the range
    [0...AL_BYTE_LENGTH_SOFT), the source's AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET will have the
    range [0...AL_SAMPLE_LENGTH_SOFT), and the source's AL_SEC_OFFSET will
    have the range [0...AL_SEC_LENGTH_SOFT).

Errors

    None.
