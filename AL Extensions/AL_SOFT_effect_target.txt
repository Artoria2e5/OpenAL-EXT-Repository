Dependencies

    This extension is for OpenAL 1.1.
    This extension depends on ALC_EXT_EFX.

Overview

    This extension provides a method to reroute the output of an auxiliary
    effect slot to the input of another auxiliary effect slot. By default, an
    effect slot's output is added to the main output along side other effect
    slots and each source's direct path. This makes it impossible to, for
    example, apply an equalizer effect to the output of a chorus effect since
    the chorus and equalizer effects are processed separately.

    Retargeting an effect slot's output to another effect slot allows chaining
    multiple effects to create results that aren't possible with standard EFX.

Additions to Specification

    AL_EFFECTSLOT_TARGET_SOFT

    Name                         Signature  Values       Default
    ---------------------------  ---------  -----------  --------------------
    AL_EFFECTSLOT_TARGET_SOFT    i, iv      {slot id}    AL_EFFECTSLOT_NULL

    Specifies the target effect slot for this effect slot's output. The
    rendered output of this effect slot is added to the input of the specified
    target effect slot, which will be subsequently processed by the target
    effect slot's effect. Specifying AL_EFFECTSLOT_NULL for the ID reverts the
    effect slot's output back to the main output.

    An effect slot that is the target of another effect slot cannot be deleted
    or an AL_INVALID_OPERATION error will be generated. An effect slot cannot
    be set as a target if it would feed its own input through 0 or more other
    effect slots, or an AL_INVALID_OPERATION error will be generated.

Errors

    An AL_INVALID_OPERATION error is generated when trying to delete an effect
    slot that is a target of another effect slot.

    An AL_INVALID_OPERATION error is generated when trying to set an effect
    slot as a target to another effect slot that would create a loop of effect
    slots.
